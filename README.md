# Thermostat

This project uses JavaScript to model a simple thermostat, which is hooked up to a dynamic visual interface with jQuery. It also uses JavaScript to fetch data from a weather API which enables the thermostat to display the temperature in London, Paris, or New York. The code was Test-Driven with Jasmine.

To run the project, simply drag the index.html file into your browser.
